In this comprehensive Tableau dashboard project, we meticulously analyzed HR data to uncover attrition patterns, focusing on various critical factors such as gender, education, age group, job satisfaction, the number of employees, and the field of education. By leveraging Tableau's powerful data visualization capabilities, the dashboard provides a series of interactive visualizations that bring to light essential trends and correlations. These visual tools enable HR managers to pinpoint the primary drivers of employee turnover with precision.

By delving into these multifaceted data points, the dashboard facilitates the formulation of strategic decisions aimed at bolstering employee retention, enhancing job satisfaction, and developing targeted interventions for groups identified as at risk. This data-driven methodology not only aids in addressing immediate concerns but also contributes to fostering a more stable and engaged workforce. Ultimately, the insights derived from this project play a pivotal role in steering organizations towards long-term success and ensuring the overall well-being of their employees. Through such a proactive approach, businesses can create a more supportive and productive work environment, benefiting both the organization and its workforce.
